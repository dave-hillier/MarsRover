* Did not have much time (I'm going away for a week) so I took less rigorous approach to testing than I might normally. 
* Tried to keep to fewer files for easier review/readability, with a preference for terser code.

* Can be run through the command line (Std In/Out) and have a test for the example scenario.

Most of the code lives in Interpreter.cs
